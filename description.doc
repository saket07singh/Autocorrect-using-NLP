1. Introduction & Use cases:
Autocorrect is a vital feature in text processing, aiding in communication by automatically correcting misspelled words. This project focuses on implementing an autocorrect feature using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, aiming to enhance text input and improve user experience.

2. Description of the Project:
The project utilizes Python and the NLTK library to develop an autocorrect system. Key components include text preprocessing, vocabulary construction, probability estimation, and correction suggestion.
3. Architecture:
The architecture of the autocorrect system involves several stages:
•	Text Preprocessing: The text is processed to lowercase and tokenize it.
•	Vocabulary Building: A vocabulary set is created containing unique words from the text.
•	Probability Calculation: The probability of each word in the vocabulary is estimated based on its frequency.
•	Correction Generation: Algorithms are implemented to suggest corrections for misspelled words.


4. Execution Plan:
•	Data Collection: Obtain text data for training the model.
•	Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize the text data.
•	Vocabulary Building: Create a set of unique words from the text.
•	Probability Calculation: Estimate the probability of each word in the vocabulary.
•	Correction Generation: Implement algorithms to suggest corrections for misspelled words.
•	Testing and Evaluation: Assess the performance of the autocorrect system using test cases and sample texts.


5. Risks Involved:
•	Limited Training Data: The availability of high-quality training data may be limited, affecting the accuracy of the autocorrect system. 

Mitigation: Augment training data or use pre-trained language models.
•	Complex NLP Algorithms: Complex algorithms may lead to longer development time and increased computational resources. 

Mitigation: Break down tasks into smaller modules and optimize algorithms for efficiency.
•	Performance Issues: Large text datasets may cause performance issues. 

Mitigation: Implement efficient data structures and algorithms for text processing.
•	Estimation Accuracy: Estimating word probabilities accurately can be challenging. 

Mitigation: Implement smoothing techniques and refine probability estimation methods.
•	Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Handling out-of-vocabulary words may impact autocorrect accuracy. 

Mitigation: Implement fallback strategies and improve vocabulary coverage.
